# Differences between Spring JDBC and Spring JPA

Spring JDBC and Spring JPA are both frameworks within the Spring ecosystem that help developers interact with databases in Java applications. However, they have different approaches and functionalities.

**Spring JDBC:**  

Spring JDBC is a lower-level framework that provides a simplified approach to working with databases using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). JDBC is a Java API that allows developers to connect to a database, execute SQL queries, and retrieve results. Spring JDBC simplifies JDBC code and provides additional features to handle common tasks.

**Key features of Spring JDBC include:**

- **DataSource management:** Spring JDBC provides a DataSource abstraction to manage connections to the database.
- **Connection management:** It handles the creation, release, and pooling of database connections.
Exception handling: Spring JDBC simplifies exception handling and converts checked JDBC exceptions to unchecked exceptions.
- **Row mapping**: It provides convenient mechanisms to map database query results to Java objects.
Spring JDBC offers more control and flexibility but requires more manual coding compared to higher-level frameworks like Spring JPA.

**Spring JPA:**

Spring JPA (Java Persistence API) is a higher-level framework that simplifies working with relational databases using the Java Persistence API, which is a standard API for object-relational mapping (ORM). Spring JPA builds on top of JPA and provides additional features and integration with the Spring framework.

**Key features of Spring JPA include:**

- **Entity mapping:** It allows mapping Java objects to database tables using annotations or XML configurations.
CRUD operations: It provides easy-to-use methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting database records.
- **Querying:** Spring JPA supports querying databases using JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) or SQL.
- **Transaction management:** It integrates with Spring's transaction management capabilities, providing declarative transaction support.
Spring JPA abstracts away many low-level details and reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed to interact with databases compared to Spring JDBC.

In summary, Spring JDBC is a lower-level framework that simplifies JDBC code, while Spring JPA is a higher-level framework that provides an abstraction layer over JPA for easier database access. Spring JPA is often the preferred choice when working with relational databases due to its productivity and simplicity, but Spring JDBC offers more control and flexibility in complex scenarios.
