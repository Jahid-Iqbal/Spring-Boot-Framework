# Dependency Injection
>Dependency injection is a design pattern that removes  the dependency of the programs. t makes the code loosely coupled.

`Students std= new Students();`

If you instantiate any object using `new` keyword then that will be tightly coupled. To solve this problem dependency injection is used.
